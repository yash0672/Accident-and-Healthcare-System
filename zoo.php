      <h1 class="w3-text-black"><u>Zoonosis</u></h1>
      <p>A zoonosis is an infectious disease that has jumped from a non-human animal to humans. Zoonotic pathogens may be bacterial, viral or parasitic, or may involve unconventional agents and can spread to humans through direct contact or through food, water or the environment. They represent a major public health problem around the world due to our close relationship with animals in agriculture, as companions and in the natural environment. Zoonoses can also cause disruptions in the production and trade of animal products for food and other uses.<br>

Zoonoses comprise a large percentage of all newly identified infectious diseases as well as many existing ones. Some diseases, such as HIV, begin as a zoonosis but later mutate into human-only strains. Other zoonoses can cause recurring disease outbreaks, such as Ebola virus disease and salmonellosis. Still others, such as the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, have the potential to cause global pandemics. </p><br>
      
      

        <h4>Who is at Risk?</h4>
        <p>Zoonotic pathogens can spread to humans through any contact point with domestic, agricultural or wild animals. Markets selling the meat or by-products of wild animals are particularly high risk due to the large number of new or undocumented pathogens known to exist in some wild animal populations. Agricultural workers in areas with a high use of antibiotics for farm animals may be at increased risk of pathogens resistant to current antimicrobial drugs. People living adjacent to wilderness areas or in semi-urban areas with higher numbers of wild animals are at risk of disease from animals such as rats, foxes or raccoons. Urbanization and the destruction of natural habitats increase the risk of zoonotic diseases by increasing contact between humans and wild animals.

      <h4>How they are transmitted?</h5>
      <p>Zoonoses can be transmitted in various ways:<br>

 -> through the air<br>
 -> by eating contaminated meat or produce<br>
 -> through close contact with an infected animal<br>
 -> by touching an area or surface that an infected animal touched<br>
 -> through insect bites like mosquitos or ticks<br>
Many transmissions occur when people hike, bike, boat, or enjoy other activities in the great outdoors.<br>

Petting zoos are also common places for a zoonotic disease to be transmitted.

Those who live and work on farms are in close contact with many types of livestock. Livestock is a common carrier of many zoonoses.<br>

Your family pet can carry ticks and fleas indoors that can then move onto you and your family.

</p> <br>

      <h4>What to do if you have a zoonotic disease?</h4>
      <p>If you have or think you have a zoonotic disease, you should contact a medical professional as soon as possible.

If you’re scratched or bitten by an animal, be sure to have the animal thoroughly checked by a veterinarian. This is to make sure that they’re appropriately vaccinated and don’t have rabies or other zoonotic diseases.<br>

If you’ve been bitten by a tick, try to preserve the tick after removal in a safe container. This way it can be identified to narrow down the possible diseases that it might transmit and tested for any of those diseases.<br>

Although zoonotic diseases are common, some people are at higher risk of getting them. These individuals may also have more severe reactions and symptoms. If you’re one of these individuals at risk, you should seek medical attention immediately if you think you may have a zoonotic disease. High-risk individuals include:<br>

 -> pregnant women<br>
 -> adults aged 65 or older<br>
 -> children 5 years old or younger<br>
 -> those with HIV<br>
 -> those with cancer who are going through chemotherapy<br>
 -> others with weakened immune systems

      <h5>Prevention tips</h5>
      <p>Zoonotic diseases are common everywhere in the world. However, the United States and other countries work constantly to reduce the number of illnesses caused by animals and insects. One way they do this is through creating food safety regulations. These regulations reduce the chances of getting a zoonotic disease from something you eat in a developed country.<br>

There are also ways to help prevent getting a zoonotic disease. These include the following:<br>

 -> Wash your hands diligently.<br>
 -> Use insect repellent or other methods to keep mosquitos, fleas, and ticks away.<br>
 -> Practice safe food handling. This includes washing off all produce before eating it.<br>
 -> Avoid being bitten or scratched by an animal.<br>
 -> Have your pets vaccinated and take them for regular annual visits to the veterinarian.<br>
 -> Talk to your veterinarian about appropriate flea and tick preventatives for your pets.<br>
 -> Check for ticks when you’ve been outside.<br>
 -> Don’t eat, drink, or touch your eyes or mouth while you’re handling or in close contact with animals.<br>
 -> Use gloves if you need to handle an animal that is or appears to be sick.<br>
 -> Keep any areas where animals are kept clean and sanitary.<br>
 -> Be aware of areas where animals or insects might be when you’re out in nature, especially when you participate in activities like hunting and camping.<br>
 -> Don’t handle or approach any animal in the wild that appears sick. Be sure to contact animal control or the local government to have the sick animal removed.
