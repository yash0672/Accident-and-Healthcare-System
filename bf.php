      <p>A rapid rise in cases of mucormycosis, also known as black fungus, has added to the challenges faced by India's healthcare system as it deals with a massive second wave of COVID-19 infections.</p>

      </video>
      <p>The disease often manifests in the skin and also affects the lungs and the brain. With a number of mucormycosis cases detected in Delhi, Maharashtra and Gujarat, experts in the national Covid-19 task force on Sunday issued an evidence-based advisory on the disease.<br></p>

        <h5>What is the disease?</h5>
        <p>Although rare, it is a serious infection. It is caused by a group of moulds known as mucormycetes present naturally in the environment. It mainly affects people who are on medication for health problems that reduces their ability to fight environmental pathogens, say experts from the Covid-19 task force task force.<br>

        Sinuses or lungs of such individuals get affected after they inhale fungal spores from the air. Doctors in some states have noted a rise in cases of mucormycosis among people hospitalized or recovering from Covid 19, with some requiring urgent surgery. Usually, mucormycetes does not pose a major threat to those with a healthy immune system.

  <p>Hospitals across India have been reporting several cases of #Mucormycosis, a rare fungal infection, affecting patients who have recently recovered from #COVID19. Mucormycosis or #blackfungus is an aggressive and invasive fungal infection caused by a group of molds called mucormycetes.</p>
</div>

  <div class="w3-row">
    <div class="w3-twothird w3-container">
      <h5>What happens when one contracts it?</h5>
      <p>Warning signs include pain and redness around the eyes or nose, with fever, headache, coughing, shortness of breath, bloody vomits, and altered mental status. According to the advisory, infection with mucormycetes should be suspected when there is:<br><br>

      * Sinusitis — nasal blockade or congestion, nasal discharge (blackish/bloody);<br>
      * Local pain on the cheek bone, one-sided facial pain, numbness or swelling;<br>
      * Blackish discoloration over bridge of nose/palate;<br>
      * Loosening of teeth, jaw involvement;<br>
      * Blurred or double vision with pain;<br>
      * Thrombosis, necrosis, skin lesion;<br>
      * Chest pain, pleural effusion, worsening of respiratory symptoms.<br><br>

      Experts advise that one should not count all cases of blocked nose as cases of bacterial sinusitis, particularly in the context of immunosuppression and/or Covid-19 patients on immunomodulators. Do not hesitate to seek aggressive investigations for detecting fungal infection, they advise.</p> <br>

      <h5>What’s the treatment?</h5>
      <p>While it is treated with antifungals, mucormycosis may eventually require surgery. Doctors have said that it is of utmost importance to control diabetes, reduce steroid use, and discontinue immunomodulating drugs. To maintain adequate systemic hydration, the treatment includes infusion of normal saline (IV) before infusion of amphotericin B and antifungal therapy, for at least 4-6 weeks.<br><br>

      Experts in the task force have stressed the need to control hyperglycemia , and monitor blood glucose level after discharge following Covid-19 treatment, and also in diabetics. One should use steroids judiciously — correct timing, correct dose and duration are important.<br><br>

      Management of Covid patients with mucormycosis is a team effort involving microbiologists, internal medicine specialists, intensivist neurologist, ENT specialists, ophthalmologists, dentists, surgeons (maxillofacial/plastic) and others.

      <h5>How can one prevent it?</h5>
      <p>One should remember that it is a rare disease. However, some groups of people are more vulnerable than others. What predisposes patients is uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression by steroids, prolonged ICU stay, and comorbidities — post transplant/malignancy, voriconazole therapy.<br><br>

      Experts advise that you use masks if you are visiting dusty construction sites. Wear shoes, long trousers, long-sleeved shirts and gloves while handling soil (gardening), moss or manure. Maintain personal hygiene including a thorough scrub bath.<br><br></p>

      <h5>What is mucormycosis?</h5>
      <p>Mucormycosis, commonly called black fungus, is a rare but serious fungal infection caused by a kind of fungus called mucormycete, which is abundant in the environment. It mainly affects people who have health problems or take medicines that lower the body’s ability to fight germs and sickness.</p>
      <h5>Symptoms</h5>
      <p>These include pain and redness around eyes and/or nose, fever, headache, coughing, shortness of breath, bloody vomits, and altered mental status. Warning signs can include toothache, loosening of teeth, blurred or double vision with pain.</p>
      <h5>Who is vulnerable</h5>
      <p>Vulnerable groups include people who have health problems or take medicines that lower the body’s ability to fight germs and sickness. These include those with diabetes, cancer, or those who have had an organ transplant.</p>
      <h5>Prevention</h5>
      <p>Use masks if you are visiting dusty construction sites. Wear shoes, long trousers, long-sleeved shirts and gloves while gardening. Maintain personal hygiene including a thorough scrub bath.</p>
      <h5>Diagnosis</h5>
      <p>It depends on the location of the suspected infection. A sample of fluid from your respiratory system may be collected for testing in the lab; otherwise a tissue biopsy or a CT scan of your lungs, sinuses etc may be conducted.</p>
      <h5>Treatment</h5>
      <p>Mucormycosis needs to be treated with prescription antifungal medicine. In some cases, it can require surgery; it can lead to eventual loss of the upper jaw and sometimes even an eye.</p>
